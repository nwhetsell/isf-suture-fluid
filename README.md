This is an [ISF shader](https://isf.video) for a fake fluid dynamical system
that creates viscous-fingeringâ€“like flow patterns and suturing along boundaries.
This particular shader is converted from
[this ShaderToy shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XddSRX). The above
screenshot is from [Videosync](https://videosync.showsync.com).

This is a multi-pass shader that is intended to be used with floating-point
buffers. Not all ISF hosts support floating-point buffers; for example,
https://editor.isf.video/ does not appear to support floating-point buffers.
[Videosync](https://videosync.showsync.com), on the other hand, supports
floating-point buffers in v2.0.12 or later (a beta version of v2.0.12 is
available
[here](https://forum.showsync.com/t/floating-point-buffers-in-isf-shaders/2490/7)).
Note that this shader will produce *very* different output if floating-point
buffers are not used.
